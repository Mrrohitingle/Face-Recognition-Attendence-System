# Face-Recognition-Attendence-System 
A facial recognition attendance system automates attendance tracking by identifying individuals based on facial features. It captures and matches faces against a database, recording attendance data accurately and securely. Integrated with existing systems, it enhances efficiency and security while minimizing manual effort. Challenges include ensuring accuracy across varying conditions and addressing privacy concerns associated with biometric data collection.
### Algorithms Used:

Utilized Haar cascade algorithm for face detection.
This algorithm is effective for detecting objects in images, particularly faces, by analyzing patterns of pixel intensities.
Employed LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm for face recognition.
LBPH is a texture-based approach for facial recognition, which extracts local features and represents them as histograms.
### Required Libraries:

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision):
Used for image processing tasks such as reading images, image manipulation, and computer vision algorithms.
NumPy:
NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.
In the context of your project, NumPy is used for:
Manipulating image data arrays obtained from OpenCV.
Performing mathematical operations on arrays for tasks like data preprocessing or feature extraction.
Handling numerical data efficiently for various computations involved in the algorithms.
pandas:
pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python.
It provides data structures and functions for manipulating structured data and time series.
In the context of your project, pandas is used for:
Loading and handling structured data related to the project, such as user information, recognition results, or configuration settings.
Cleaning and preprocessing data before feeding it into the algorithms.
Analyzing and summarizing data to gain insights or evaluate the performance of the system.
Facilitating integration with the MySQL database, allowing for efficient handling of data retrieval and storage operations.
Tk (Tkinter):
Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit, utilized for creating user interfaces for the application.
Pillow:
A Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork, used for image processing tasks like opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.
OS:
Python's built-in module for interacting with the operating system. It could be used for tasks like file manipulation, directory operations, etc.
RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) Server - MySQL:
Used as the backend database server for storing information related to the application, such as user data, recognition results, etc.
Python Connector for MySQL:
This allows Python to communicate with the MySQL database, facilitating operations like inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data from the database within the Python environment.
